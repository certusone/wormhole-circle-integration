## 3rd Party Security Audits

At the time of writing, the wormhole circle integration project has not undergone any 3rd party security audits. However, in the future 3rd party firms shall be engaged to conduct independent security audits.

As these 3rd party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audit reports public.

- Q1 2023 - TBD

## Bug Bounty Program

We are in the process of designing a **bug bounty program** for Wormhole Circle Integration.

In the mean-time, if you find a security issue, we ask that you reach out to our team via this [form](https://wormhole.com/bounty/).
